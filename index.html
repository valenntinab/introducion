all-american bitch

<p>I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board<br>
I pay attention to things that most people ignore<br>
And I'm alright with the movies<br>
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure</p>
<p>And I am built like a mother and a total machine<br>
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean<br>
And I make light of the darkness<br>
I've got Sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe<br>
Yeah, you know me, I-I-I</p>

<p>Forgive and I forget<br>
I know my age and I act like it<br>
Got what you can't resist<br>
I'm a perfect all-American</p>

<p>I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air<br>
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair<br>
I got class and integrity<br>
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear<br>
With love to spare, I</p>

<p>Forgive and I forget<br>
I know my age and I act like it<br>
Got what you can't resist<br>
I'm a perfect all-American bitch<br>
With perfect all-American lips<br>
And perfect all-American hips<br>
I know my place, I know my place, and this is it</p>

<p>I don't get angry when I'm pissedv<br>
I'm the eternal optimist<br>
I scream inside to deal with it, like: Ah<br>
Like: Aah</p>

<p>All the time<br>
I'm grateful all the time<br>
I'm sexy and I'm kind<br>
I'm pretty when I cry</p>
<p>Oh, all the time<br>
I'm grateful all the time (all the fucking time)<br>
I'm sexy and I'm kind<br>
I'm pretty when I cry</p>

<h3>pretty isn´t pretty</h3>
<p>Bought a bunch of makeup<br>
Tryna cover up my face<br>
I started to skip lunch<br>
Stopped eating cake on birthdays</p>
<p>Bought a new prescription<br>
To try and stay calm<br>
'Cause there's always something missing<br>
There's always something in the mirror that I think looks wrong</p>

<p>When pretty isn't pretty enough<br>
What do you do?<br>
And everybody's keeping it up<br>
So you think it's you<br>
I could change up my body and change up my face<br>
I could try every lipstick in every shade<br>
But I'd always feel the same<br>
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyway</p>

<p>You can win the battle<br>
But you'll never win the war<br>
You fix the things you hated<br>
And you'd still feel so insecure</p>

<p>And I try to ignore it, but it's everything I see<br>
It's on the poster on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines<br>
It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed<br>
It's all around, it's all the time, I don't know why I even try</p>

<p>When pretty isn't pretty enough<br>
What do you do?<br>
And everybody's keeping it up<br>
So you think it's you<br>
I could change up my body and change up my face<br>
I could try every lipstick in every shade<br>
But I'd always feel the same<br>
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough</p>

<p>And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy<br>
I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life<br>
And none of it matters and none of it ends<br>
You just feel like shit over and over again</p>

<p>(No, it'll never change) pretty isn't pretty enough<br>
Everybody's keeping it up (oh)<br>
Pretty isn't pretty enough<br>
Pretty isn't</p>

<h3>love is embarrassing</h3>
<p>I told my friends you were the one<br>
After I'd known you like a month<br>
And then you kissed some girl from high school<br>
And I stayed in bed for like a week<br>
When you said space was what you need<br>
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool</p>

<p>And now it don't mean a thing<br>
God, love's fucking embarrassing<br>
Just watch as I crucify myself<br>
For some weird second string<br>
Loser who's not worth mentioning<br>
My God, love's embarrassing as hell</p>

<p>And I consoled you while you cried<br>
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy<br>
My God, how could I be so stupid?<br>
You found a new version of me<br>
And I damn near started World War III<br>
Jesus, what was I even doing?</p>

<p>'Cause now it don't mean a thing<br>
God, love's fucking embarrassing<br>
Just watch as I crucify myself<br>
For some weird second string<br>
Loser who's not worth mentioning<br>
My God, love's embarrassing as hell</p>

<p>I give up, give up, I give up everything<br>
I placed my bets and it's not worth anything<br>
I give up, give up, but I keep coming back for more</p>

<p>Yeah, it don't mean a thing<br>
God, love's fucking embarrassing<br>
Just watch as I crucify myself<br>
Hey, hey, hey
For some weird second string<br>
Loser who's not worth mentioning<br>
My God, love's embarrassing as hell</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, I give up, give up, I give up everything<br>
I'm planning out my wedding with some guy I'm never marrying<br>
I'm giving up, I'm giving up, but I keep coming back for more</p>
